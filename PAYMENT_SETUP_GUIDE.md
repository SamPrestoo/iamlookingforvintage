This guide will help you set up Stripe payments and SMS notifications for your vintage clothing website.

## üè¶ Phase 1: Stripe Account Setup

### Step 1: Create Stripe Account
1. Go to [https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. Click "Start now" and sign up with your business email
3. Complete business verification with your bank account details
4. **IMPORTANT**: Switch to "Test mode" (toggle in top right) for testing

### Step 2: Get API Keys
1. In Stripe Dashboard, go to **Developers ‚Üí API Keys**
2. Copy these keys (keep them secure!):
   - **Publishable key**: `pk_test_...` (safe to use in frontend)
   - **Secret key**: `sk_test_...` (keep secret!)

### Step 3: Set up Webhooks
1. Go to **Developers ‚Üí Webhooks**
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. Endpoint URL: `https://[your-site-name].netlify.app/.netlify/functions/stripe-webhook`
4. Select these events:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
5. Click "Add endpoint"
6. Copy the **Signing secret**: `whsec_...`

## üìß Phase 2: Email Notifications Setup (Free!)

### Step 1: Choose Your Admin Email
- Use your business email address where you want to receive sale notifications
- This will be where order confirmations are sent when customers make purchases

## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 3: Environment Variables Setup

### In Netlify Dashboard:
1. Go to your site's dashboard
2. Navigate to **Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables**
3. Add these variables one by one:

```bash
# Stripe Configuration (Required)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_[your_secret_key_here]
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_[your_publishable_key_here] 
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_[your_webhook_secret_here]

# Email Notifications (Required)
ADMIN_EMAIL=your.business.email@gmail.com
```

### Important Notes:
- **Never** commit these keys to Git
- Use Test keys (`pk_test_` and `sk_test_`) until you're ready for production
- The webhook secret is different for each endpoint you create
