# Stripe Payment Integration Guide

This guide will help you set up Stripe payment processing for your vintage clothing website.

## What is Stripe?

Stripe is a comprehensive payment processing platform that allows businesses to accept online payments securely. It handles credit cards, debit cards, and other payment methods while ensuring PCI compliance and security.

## Benefits of Using Stripe

- **Secure Processing**: PCI DSS compliant with advanced fraud protection
- **Global Reach**: Accepts payments in 135+ currencies from customers worldwide  
- **Developer Friendly**: Well-documented APIs and extensive customization options
- **Competitive Pricing**: Transparent fee structure (2.9% + 30¬¢ per transaction)
- **Real-time Tracking**: Detailed analytics and reporting dashboard
- **Mobile Optimized**: Works seamlessly on all devices

## Current Implementation Status

‚úÖ **Frontend Template**: Complete checkout flow with Stripe Elements  
‚úÖ **Cart Functionality**: Add to cart, remove items, calculate totals  
‚úÖ **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile  
üîÑ **Demo Mode**: Currently configured for testing (no real payments)  
‚ùå **Backend Integration**: Requires server-side implementation  

## Setting Up Stripe (Step by Step)

### 1. Create a Stripe Account
1. Go to [stripe.com](https://stripe.com) and sign up
2. Complete account verification with business details
3. Set up your business profile and bank account for payouts

### 2. Get Your API Keys
1. In your Stripe Dashboard, go to **Developers** > **API Keys**
2. Copy your **Publishable Key** (starts with `pk_test_` for testing)
3. Copy your **Secret Key** (starts with `sk_test_` for testing)
4. Keep your Secret Key secure - never expose it in frontend code

### 3. Update Frontend Configuration
In `checkout.html`, replace the demo key:

```javascript
// Replace this demo key with your actual publishable key
const stripe = Stripe('pk_test_YOUR_ACTUAL_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE');
```

### 4. Set Up Backend Payment Processing
**Note**: This requires a backend server (Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.)

Example server endpoint needed:
```javascript
// POST /create-payment-intent
app.post('/create-payment-intent', async (req, res) => {
  const { cart, customer_details } = req.body;
  
  const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
    amount: calculateTotalAmount(cart), // in cents
    currency: 'usd',
    metadata: {
      customer_email: customer_details.email,
      items: JSON.stringify(cart.map(item => ({
        id: item.id,
        name: item.name,
        quantity: item.quantity
      })))
    }
  });
  
  res.send({
    client_secret: paymentIntent.client_secret
  });
});
```

### 5. Handle Webhooks (Recommended)
Set up webhook endpoints to handle payment events:
- `payment_intent.succeeded` - Mark order as paid
- `payment_intent.payment_failed` - Handle failed payments
- Configure webhook URL in Stripe Dashboard

## Current File Structure

```
/checkout.html          - Complete Stripe checkout page
/script.js              - Cart functionality and product management
/products.json          - Product inventory with sold status tracking
/admin-login.html       - Admin authentication
/admin-dashboard.html   - Inventory management interface
```

## Admin System Features

### Admin Dashboard (`/admin`)
- **Login**: Admin credentials stored securely in environment variables
- **Security**: Session-based authentication (2-hour timeout)
- **Access**: Manage inventory, add/remove products

### Inventory Management (`admin-dashboard.html`)
- **Add Products**: Name, images (up to 10), type, size, description, price
- **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design for phone/tablet management
- **Image Handling**: Drag & drop or click to upload
- **Product Status**: Track sold vs available items

## Product Data Structure

Each product includes:
```json
{
  "id": "unique_id",
  "name": "Product Name",
  "description": "Detailed description",
  "price": 45.00,
  "category": "clothing|accessories|collectibles",
  "type": "jacket|dress|handbag|etc",
  "size": "Small|Medium|Large|One Size",
  "sold": false,
  "images": ["base64_image_data"],
  "thumbnailIndex": 0
}
```

## Testing Your Integration

### 1. Test Credit Card Numbers (Stripe Test Mode)
- **Success**: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- **Declined**: 4000 0000 0000 0002
- **Requires Authentication**: 4000 0025 0000 3155

### 2. Test the Complete Flow
1. Add products to cart
2. Proceed to checkout
3. Fill in customer details
4. Use test credit card
5. Verify successful payment simulation

## Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Do's
- Use HTTPS for all payment pages
- Validate all inputs on both frontend and backend
- Use Stripe's secure Elements for card input
- Store customer data securely (if needed)
- Implement proper error handling
- Set up webhook endpoint validation

### ‚ùå Don'ts
- Never store credit card information
- Don't expose Secret API keys in frontend code
- Don't skip input validation
- Don't ignore webhook events
- Don't forget to test error scenarios

## Going Live

1. ‚úÖ Complete Stripe account verification
2. ‚úÖ Backend server with payment processing
3. ‚úÖ SSL certificate for your domain
4. ‚úÖ Webhook endpoints configured
5. ‚úÖ Test all payment scenarios

### Switch to Production

2. Update webhook endpoints to production URLs
3. Test with small amounts first
4. Monitor transactions in Stripe Dashboard
