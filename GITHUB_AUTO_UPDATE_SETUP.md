# 🔄 GitHub Auto-Update Setup Guide

## Overview
This system allows your admin dashboard to automatically commit changes to your GitHub repository when you add products, mark items as sold, or delete items. Your website will then automatically update since it deploys from the repository.

## 🛡️ Security Features
- **Secure Token Storage**: GitHub tokens are stored locally in your browser only
- **Minimal Permissions**: Token only needs access to your specific repository
- **Official GitHub API**: Uses GitHub's official REST API for all operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages and recovery options

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Generate GitHub Personal Access Token

1. **Go to GitHub Settings**
   - Navigate to [GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

2. **Create New Token**
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give it a descriptive name: `iamlookingforvintage-admin-auto-update`
   - Set expiration (recommended: 1 year)

3. **Select Permissions**
   - ✅ **repo** - Full control of private repositories
   - ❌ Leave all other permissions unchecked for security

4. **Generate and Copy Token**
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token immediately (starts with `ghp_` or `github_pat_`)
   - You won't be able to see it again!

### Step 2: Configure in Admin Dashboard

1. **Login to Admin**
   - Go to your admin login page
   - Enter your admin credentials

2. **Navigate to GitHub Settings**
   - Click the "GitHub Settings" tab in admin dashboard

3. **Enter Token**
   - Paste your GitHub token in the "GitHub Personal Access Token" field
   - Click "Save Token"

4. **Test Connection**
   - Click "Test Connection" button
   - You should see: "✅ Connected to SamPrestoo/iamlookingforvintage"

## 🔧 How It Works

### Automatic Operations

Once configured, the system automatically commits to your repository when you:

1. **Add New Product**
   - Product saved to localStorage (immediate visibility)
   - Auto-commit to GitHub with descriptive message
   - Your website updates within minutes

2. **Mark Item as Sold**
   - Status updated in localStorage (immediate visibility)
   - Auto-commit to GitHub with sold status
   - Your website reflects sold status

3. **Delete Product**
   - Item removed from localStorage (immediate removal)
   - Auto-commit to GitHub removing the product
   - Your website removes the item

### Commit Messages
The system creates professional commit messages like:
```
Add new product: Vintage Leather Jacket

🛍️ Added via admin dashboard
- Name: Vintage Leather Jacket  
- Price: $85.00
- Category: clothing
- Type: jacket
- Size: Medium

🤖 Automated commit via GitHub API
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Invalid GitHub token" Error
- **Cause**: Token format is wrong or token has expired
- **Solution**: Generate new token, ensure it starts with `ghp_` or `github_pat_`

#### "Repository not found" Error  
- **Cause**: Token lacks permissions or wrong repository name
- **Solution**: Ensure token has "repo" permission scope

#### "Insufficient permissions" Error
- **Cause**: Token doesn't have write access to repository
- **Solution**: Regenerate token with "repo" scope selected

#### Products don't appear after adding
- **Cause**: GitHub integration failed but localStorage worked
- **Solution**: Check GitHub settings tab for error messages, products still visible locally

### Recovery Options

If auto-commit fails:
1. Products remain visible on your site (stored in localStorage)
2. Use "Export Products JSON" button as backup
3. Manually replace products.json in repository
4. Fix GitHub token issue and retry
